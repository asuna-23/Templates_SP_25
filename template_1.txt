On [Date], our section took a break from work and hit the court for a fun and competitive basketball game. We split into three teams and played friendly matches that brought out our team spirit, laughter, and some impressive basketball moves.

This mini teambuilding was a great way to bond, get active, and enjoy some time away from our desks. Here's a quick look at what went down on and off the court!
